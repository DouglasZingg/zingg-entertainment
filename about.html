        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <section class="about-section">
            <p>
                I’m a tools and pipeline-focused developer with experience in game development
                and technical systems. I enjoy building reliable tools and automation that
                support production workflows, reduce manual work, and scale across teams.
            </p>

            <p>
                My work often sits at the intersection of engineering and content creation.
                I’ve built editor tools, pipeline utilities, and workflow automation using
                C++, C#, Python, and JavaScript, with a strong emphasis on maintainability
                and real-world production constraints.
            </p>

            <p>
                I value clear communication and collaboration across disciplines, and I enjoy
                working closely with artists, designers, and engineers to turn complex or
                ambiguous requirements into practical, usable tools.
            </p>
